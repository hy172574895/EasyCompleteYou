## Q: Why there are a few of [Snippets](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5472/snippet-programming) options to complete? I need more.  
A: ECY relies on `Ultisnips` which is a engine that fill in the snippets fragment. What snippets you provide to `Ultisnips`, what completion options you got in ECY.
So there are so many nice and mature snippets that made by other fellows such as  
 [honza/vim-snippets](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets) or [CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets). If you want more, install the snippets you admire and `Ultisnips` will analize that snippets then provide to ECY and last to users.
